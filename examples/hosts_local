# This is a simple ansible 'hosts' file. A hosts file is only used for
# static lists of hosts that ansible will operate on. (Most operations
# in the Ansible update process will be on a set of hosts pulled
# dynamically from Heat.)
#
# In the simple update playbook
# (examples/playbooks/simple_rebuild.yml), the only host Ansible
# interacts with directly is localhost, as the update itself runs
# through Nova.
